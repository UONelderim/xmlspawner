# XmlSpawner2 for ServUO publish 58

This branch contains customized content for polish shard http://nelderim.pl/ 
It may not work with any ServUO based shard out of the box.

This repo is a copy of https://code.google.com/archive/p/xmlspawner/source with changes required to Plug&Play on ServUO pub 58. 

Plan is to keep it working with ServUO p58 (or maybe even later versions) and possibly do a cleanup of the code base.

# How to install

1. Remove original files of XmlSpawner from ServUO
2. Put files from this repository somwehere in ServUO/Scripts directory
